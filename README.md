### Bolchie Run 

A video game developed in Unity 2D for the "C# Course for Video Games"

**In this course we see**

In this course I developed my first platform video game.

I learned how to import assets, create prefabs, create animations, design scenarios, handle switching between scenes in Unity, and master the basics of C#, the Unity programming language.
